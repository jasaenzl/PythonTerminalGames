# Hangman Console Game

This is a Hangman game developed in Python to be run in the command line interface. The game follows the classic rules of Hangman, where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter before the hangman drawing is completed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `hangman.py` file is located.
3. Run the game by typing the following command:

    python ahorcado.py

## How to Play

1. Upon starting the game, a board will be displayed with the hidden word represented by dashes (`-`).
2. The player can input one letter on each turn.
3. If the entered letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed on the board.
4. If the letter is not in the word, a guess will be subtracted from the player's remaining attempts.
5. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
